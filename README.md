===========

like Pandora's Box, but sketchier.

We just need to make something convincing by monday.
I've registered an app with SoundCloud, so if you need the key/secret, just email me and I'll send it to you. You need a url to use everything, too. You can use your ip but it'll be a hassle to keep changing it. It might be best to upload a working copy to one of our aws accounts. Anywaz, happa spring weekend yall.
